# Soundwaves - Interactive Name Generator

## Project Overview

This interactive name generator was created as part of a design university project focused on algorithmic art and interactive installations. The project explores the intersection of visual design, user interaction, and algorithmic generation.

## Project Context

This application was developed for a university design course where students were tasked with:

1. Creating an algorithmic design system
2. Implementing interactive elements
3. Filming the interaction process
4. Deploying the project on Glitch.com

The project demonstrates the application of algorithmic thinking in design, where simple rules and user interactions create dynamic visual experiences.

## Technical Implementation

The application is built using:

-   p5.js for creative coding and interactive graphics
-   JavaScript for logic and user interaction
-   Glitch.com for hosting and deployment

### Features

-   Interactive name generation on click/touch
-   Visual feedback through color transitions
-   Responsive design that adapts to window size
-   Mobile-friendly interface
-   Generation counter to track interactions

### How It Works

1. The application displays a randomly selected name from a predefined list
2. Each interaction (click or touch) generates a new name
3. The background and text colors toggle with each generation
4. A minimum delay between generations prevents rapid-fire interactions
5. The generation count is displayed at the bottom of the screen

## Installation & Usage

1. Clone this repository or visit the Glitch.com project
2. Open the application in a web browser
3. Click or touch the screen to generate new names
4. The application will work on both desktop and mobile devices

## Project Requirements

-   Modern web browser with JavaScript enabled
-   Touch or mouse input capability
-   Internet connection for Glitch.com deployment
